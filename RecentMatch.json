      beat West Ham to extend their three-point lead over Liverpool at the top of the table. The Reds are in 
      FA Cup action as they face Chelsea at Wembley at Saturday, offering City the chance to stretch their
      advantage to six points and further boost a seven-goal lead on goal difference. City have been in 
      scintillating form since a 2-2 draw with Liverpool last month left the title race on a knife edge.
      Pep Guardiola's men have struck 22 goals in five games since to close in on a fourth title in five
      seasons.Another convincing win at the London Stadium and the title will be realistically won given City's better goal difference."
